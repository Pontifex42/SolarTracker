A solar tracker by instructions of a blog at AZ-Delivery.de

My favourite electronics distributor "AZ-delivery" has a blog where they posted a manual to create a "Solar Tracker" out of plywood. I asked the creator for a sketch so I can create STL for a 3D printer. He did me the favour and here we go. Yes, there are already plenty of Solar Tracker designs around, so what. Now it is one more.

To find schematics and sourcecode for Arduino UNO, just visit the (german) blog page: https://www.az-delivery.de/blogs/azdelivery-blog-fur-arduino-und-raspberry-pi/solar-tracker-mit-schrittmotoren-und-oled-display

You can find a part list there, too.

My device is a bit different. I used a Wemos D1 R32 board, which is pin-compatible to UNO boards, but offers much more power, PINs, WLAN/Bluetooth and much more. I used a breadboard instead of a perfboard. I hate working with perfboards, I'd rather drown the breadboard in hot glue. Only alternative for me is making a real PCB, which looks a bit too much work for this toy.

To see it working, have a look at the video in the Media directory. https://github.com/Pontifex42/SolarTracker
